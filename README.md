# pancard_extraction
This project extracts the data from the pancards with the help of Dl-OCR method using libraries such as OpenCV, Pytesseract etc. These libraries help in removal of noise and preprocessing of the image and help in accurate data extraction.
Data is extracted with a high accuracy from a dataset of multiple pancards with different formats.
